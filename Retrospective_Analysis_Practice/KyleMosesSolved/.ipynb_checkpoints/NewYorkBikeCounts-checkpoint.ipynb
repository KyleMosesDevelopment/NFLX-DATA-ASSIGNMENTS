    "# RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS\n",
    "## I approached this analysis by attempting to find a correlation between High Temp and number of people crossing the Brooklyn bridge. What I found was that there is a positive relationship between HIGHER TEMPS and more people crossing the Brooklyn bridge on bikes. This is most likely due to the fact that people want to ride their bikes more when the weather is nice outside, not too cold. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Only using High temp and not Low temp could potentially be a risk when trying to predict how many people will cross the Brooklyn bridge. If the High is a 66(°F), but the actual temp of that day is closer to the Low of 44(°F), my model would probably predict more people would cross the bridge on bike than the actual amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I should done is look at how the Low temp correlates to how many people cross the brooklyn bridge, as well as factors such as Precipitation. Using these three factors, one might be able to predict how many people cross the Brooklyn Bridge on bike more accuratly on a based off of what the weather is looking like on a specific day. \n"
